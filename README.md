This is just a simple game with some extra steps to make it cooler (for me) and to feel like I'm onboard the Enterprise D with the best crew of Star Trek.

If you want to play, then make it so.

P.D: I did it all with JS just to understand better the DOM manipulation. This is not the correct way to do it (using css and html could be an easy way), but as an excersise it was awesome and very challenging. So I will understand if this point gets a lot of critics, and do not worry, you are right.
